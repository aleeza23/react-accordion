        "question": "What is React?",
        "answer": "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update the user interface by leveraging a virtual DOM."
      },
      {
        "id" :2,
        "question": "What are React Components?",
        "answer": "React Components are the building blocks of a React application. They encapsulate UI logic, state, and props, allowing developers to create modular, reusable, and manageable parts of the user interface."
      },
      {
        "id" :3,
        "question": "What is JSX?",
        "answer": "JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It simplifies the process of creating and rendering React elements."
      },
      {
        "id" :4,
        "question": "What are Props?",
        "answer": "Props (short for 'properties') are a mechanism for passing data from parent to child components in React. They are read-only and help make components more dynamic and customizable."
      },
      {
        "id" :5,
        "question": "What is State in React?",
        "answer": "State is a way to manage and store data that can change over time within a component. When state data changes, React re-renders the component to reflect the updated information."
      },
      {
        "id" :6,
        "question": "What are React Hooks?",
        "answer": "React Hooks are functions that allow developers to use state and other React features in functional components. Hooks, introduced in React 16.8, provide a more concise way to manage component logic."
      },
      {
        "id" :7,
        "question": "What is the Virtual DOM?",
        "answer": "The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM (Document Object Model) that React uses for performance optimization. It enables efficient updates by comparing changes and minimizing DOM manipulations."
      },
      {
        "id" :8,
        "question": "What is Reconciliation in React?",
        "answer": "Reconciliation is the process by which React updates the actual DOM based on changes made to the Virtual DOM. React's algorithm ensures that only necessary changes are applied, improving performance."
